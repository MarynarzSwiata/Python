# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# Day 1: Input and Output
# Today's Progress: Completed a simple program that takes user input for name and age, then prints a welcome message. Calculator of pizza price per person based on number of people and tip percentage.
# Thoughts: I found it interesting to see how input and output work in Python. I also learned about f-strings for formatting output and basic conditional statements.


# This is first line of code which prints my name and welcome message.
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Welcome {name}, age {age}!")
