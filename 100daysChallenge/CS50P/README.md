## Day 1: Getting Started with Python

**Date:** 2025-10-31

Today marked the beginning of my CS50P adventure! I started with Week 0, which focused on the absolute basics of Python.

**Key Learnings:**

- **`print()` function:** How to display output to the console.
- **`input()` function:** How to get user input.
- **Variables:** Storing data in memory.
- **Basic data types:** `str` (strings) and `int` (integers).
- **String concatenation:** Combining strings.
- **F-strings:** A more modern and readable way to format strings.
- **Arithmetic operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo).
- **Comments:** How to add notes to my code.

**Problem Sets/Exercises Completed:**

- **`hello.py`:** A simple program to print "hello, world".
- **`playback.py`:** Slowing down speech
