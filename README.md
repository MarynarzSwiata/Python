# My First Steps in Python

Hello! I'm a beginner just starting my journey with Python. This repository is where I'll be documenting my progress, experiments, and learning as I take my first steps into the world of programming with Python.

I'm excited to learn and grow, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions from more experienced developers.

## What you'll find here:

*   **Basic Scripts:** Simple Python programs as I learn fundamental concepts.
*   **Learning Notes:** My personal notes and summaries of what I'm learning.
*   **Small Projects:** As I gain confidence, I'll start working on small, beginner-friendly projects.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
